# LIGN 167 FA22 Final Project: Customed Neural Network

This repository contains our implementation of a Neural Network using python and numpy **(without tensorflow,keras or pytorch)** . This part of our final project is completed by Ruinan Ma. The feature data, `features_3_sec.csv`, is extracted from the original audio files in the GTZAN dataset. The code for extracting feature is in the another notebook we submitted.

## Instruction to run the code

Please use the following command to run our code:

```#!/bin/bash
$python3 main.py
```

Please change the ``configFile`` in ``main.py`` to test different models.
The output plots will be saved in `/output` dictery with the same name as the corresponding config file name.
